This page provides a live GFM preview, rendered client-side using javascript.
The majority of the credit goes to the wonderful [Showdown](http://attacklab.net/showdown/) script, which handles the meat of the processing.
GFM modifications for newlines and underscore-words were added.  "GitHub spice" syntaxes have not yet been implemented.
