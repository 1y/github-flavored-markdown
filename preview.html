<p>This page provides a live GFM preview, rendered client-side using javascript.
  The majority of the credit goes to the wonderful <a href="http://attacklab.net/showdown/">Showdown</a> script, which handles the meat of the processing.
  GFM modifications for newlines and underscore-words were added.  "GitHub spice" syntaxes have not yet been implemented.
